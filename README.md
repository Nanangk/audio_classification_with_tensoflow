We are going to create a deep learning model and train it to learn to classify audio files. Audio classification usually does not get the same kind of attention as image classification with deep learning - this could be because audio processing that is typically used in such scenarios is not as straight forward as image data. In this project, we will look at one such processing to convert raw audio into spectrograms before using them in a convolutional neural network.
